# GridAI

**Policy decisions don’t have to be slow, uncertain, or expensive. GridAI proves they can be fast, data-driven, and transparent.**

## What is GridAI?

GridAI is a first-of-its-kind reinforcement learning system built to design national energy strategies—starting with Ireland’s path to net-zero. Developed entirely from scratch in Rust, it simulates over **250,000 full-scale national energy transitions** to discover the most efficient, cost-effective, and publicly acceptable routes to a net-zero grid.

This isn’t some black-box AI. GridAI is **fully interpretable**, **fully deterministic**, and built to explain its reasoning. It doesn’t just give you the “what”—it tells you *why*.

## The Results

After simulating over 2.5 million years of policy outcomes in less than an hour, GridAI delivered:

- **Net-negative emissions by 2050**
- **100% power reliability**
- **€76B total cost** (vs. €120B in legacy reports)
- A fully detailed infrastructure breakdown, including years of construction, coordinates, size, and cost for:
  - 41,000 acres of solar farms
  - 23,000 wind turbines
  - 18TWh of battery storage
  - 42TWh of wave energy
  - 1.8Mt of carbon offsets

All while achieving a model-aligned **public support score over 90%**.

## Why It Matters

Energy systems are complex. Decisions about them often get trapped in bureaucracy, lack transparency, or rely on outdated tools. GridAI offers a new approach: simulate every possibility, score every outcome, and surface the best. Then let *humans* decide with confidence.

We believe this tool can transform **not just energy policy**, but how entire nations approach long-term planning. From transport to housing to climate adaptation—any complex, evolving system could be modelled and improved using this approach.

## Built Differently

- ⚙️ **13,000+ lines of Rust code**  
- 🧠 **Custom-built policy gradient reinforcement learning**  
- 🗺️ **Real-world population, generation, and cost data**  
- 🔬 **Multi-objective optimisation: cost, emissions, reliability, and opinion**  
- 💻 **Runs on consumer hardware—no cloud, no black boxes**

## Recognition & Next Steps

GridAI placed in the **top 5 out of 170+** entries in EirGrid’s CleanerGrid competition and was presented to national stakeholders including **EirGrid's Head of Innovation**. It has since gained traction with researchers, journalists, and educators.

We’re now:
- Improving the model fidelity
- Expanding beyond Ireland
- Building a full policy interface
- Preparing it for **real-world deployment**
