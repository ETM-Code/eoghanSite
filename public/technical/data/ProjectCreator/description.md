# Project Formatter For Website Display

This project is a formatter designed to quickly and easily create the folders I need to showcase my projects in the format you are currently viewing. For this reason, I believe the project speaks for itself.

It is a simple Electron app that takes inputs and uses the file service to create a new folder and write the relevant files to it. While not an extraordinary project, it has significantly increased my efficiency in creating these displays.
