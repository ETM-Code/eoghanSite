# Roast Bot

**Roast Bot** is a humorous project created during a hackathon. The concept involves using large language models (LLMs) to generate degrading descriptions of participants, which were found to be quite amusing by those who took part.

Roast Bot accepts an image input, which is processed through the ChatGPT API to generate a description. However, since ChatGPT has certain censorship limitations, an alternative model, LLAMA-3, was used to generate the required insults. Due to computational restrictions, the model is hosted using HuggingChat and accessed via the unofficial HuggingChat API (credit to Soulter on GitHub).

Roast Bot is currently hosted [here](projects/roastbot), where you can try it out. However, please limit the number of uses, as I do not plan to renew my OpenAI credits for this project.
It is also quite possible that changes to the HuggingChat API or a cracking-down on its use may render this obsolete. I'll try to avoid that if I can.
